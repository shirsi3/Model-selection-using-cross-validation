    <h1>Lab 5: Machine Learning and Feature Selection</h1>
    <p>This lab includes scripts that explore various machine learning models, feature selection techniques, and their applications in a dataset context.</p>

    <h2>1. lab5a.py - Data Sampling</h2>
    <p>This script focuses on sampling data from a dataset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Selects random samples of benign and malware data from a dataset for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries Used:</strong> pandas, random</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. lab5b.py - Feature Selection and SVM Classification</h2>
    <p>This script demonstrates the use of feature selection methods in conjunction with SVM classification.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Implements feature selection techniques and evaluates SVM performance using cross-validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries Used:</strong> numpy, pandas, sklearn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. lab5c.py - Model Evaluation with Feature Selection</h2>
    <p>This script evaluates different machine learning models with feature selection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Evaluates various classifiers with feature selection using cross-validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries Used:</strong> numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. lab5d2.py - Feature Selection, Classification, and System Operations</h2>
    <p>This script focuses on feature selection, SVM classification, model serialization, and system operations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Selects features, trains an SVM classifier, serializes the model, and possibly performs system-level operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries Used:</strong> pandas, numpy, sklearn, pickle, json, datetime, subprocess, os, hashlib</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Note: This documentation provides an overview of each script's primary functionality. For detailed usage and code explanations, refer to comments within each script.</em></p>
