# Lab 5: Machine Learning and Feature Selection

This lab includes scripts that explore various machine learning models, feature selection techniques, and their applications in a dataset context.

## 1. lab5a.py - Data Sampling

- **Functionality:** Selects random samples of benign and malware data from a dataset for analysis.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, random

## 2. lab5b.py - Feature Selection and SVM Classification

- **Functionality:** Implements feature selection techniques and evaluates SVM performance using cross-validation.
- **Libraries Used:** numpy, pandas, sklearn

## 3. lab5c.py - Model Evaluation with Feature Selection

- **Functionality:** Evaluates various classifiers with feature selection using cross-validation.
- **Libraries Used:** numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib

## 4. lab5d2.py - Feature Selection, Classification, and System Operations

- **Functionality:** Selects features, trains an SVM classifier, serializes the model, and possibly performs system-level operations.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, pickle, json, datetime, subprocess, os, hashlib
